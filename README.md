# 🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores risk factors associated with lung cancer severity using demographic and behavioral data. The goal was to identify trends and high-risk profiles to support data-driven approaches in healthcare research and public health awareness.

Using **Tableau**, I created interactive visualizations that revealed patterns between patient demographics, lifestyle habits, and lung cancer risk scores—enabling fast insights and data exploration by non-technical audiences.

## 💡 Project Motivation

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early identification of high-risk groups can significantly improve outcomes. This project aims to help surface insights from structured health data to support preventative research and education.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset - Lung Cancer & Air Pollution](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/cancer-patients-and-air-pollution-a-new-link)
- **Data Includes**:
  - Age, gender, air pollution levels
  - Alcohol use, smoking history
  - Fatigue, chronic diseases
  - Lung cancer severity score (1–3)

---

## ❓ Key Questions

- Which demographic groups are associated with higher cancer severity?
- Does smoking or air pollution correlate more strongly with risk?
- What patterns emerge when visualizing multiple risk factors together?

---

## 🔍 Analysis Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
   - Standardized categorical variables for visual grouping

2. **Visualization with Tableau**
   - Explored variable relationships using scatter plots, heat maps, and bar charts
   - Designed an interactive story dashboard for end-user presentation

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Individuals aged 60+ with high exposure to air pollution and a history of smoking had a higher likelihood of severity level 3.
- Gender differences in severity were less pronounced than expected.
- Combined risk factors (e.g. alcohol + pollution + chronic diseases) showed a compounding effect on severity.

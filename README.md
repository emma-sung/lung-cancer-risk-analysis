# 🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Analysis

## 🔍 About

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data to identify **high-risk factors** associated with **lung cancer severity**. My goal was to uncover meaningful patterns within patient demographics to inform better understanding and support research on risk stratification.

Using **Tableau**, I created interactive visualizations to explore correlations between variables like **age**, **smoking history**, and other demographic factors with lung cancer risk. These visualizations provided stakeholders with insights into key patterns and trends, helping guide further research and health interventions.
